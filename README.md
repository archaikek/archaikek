- 👋 Hi, I’m @archaikek, also known as Archaic or Archaic84 on the internet. In spite of the number in the nickname I'm not actually from 1984. I'm a fresher at Gdańsk University of Technology, studying informatics at the Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, and I'm a holder of the bronze medal in Polish Olympiad in Informatics from 2021.
- 👀 I’m interested in maths and computer science, and outside of science it's music, psychology and game design that catch my interests.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of the .NET and Java technological platforms, and low-level programming of microcontrollers.
- 💞️ I'm looking to be a part of a bigger project, preferably with me working in the C language - I started programming in it around 8 years ago and I feel the most confident working with it.
