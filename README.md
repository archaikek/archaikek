- 👋 Hi, I’m @archaikek, also known as Archaic or Archaic84 on the internet. In spite of the number in the nickname I'm not actually from 1984. I'm a fresher at Gdańsk University of Technology, studying informatics at the faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, and I'm a holder of the bronze medal in Polish Olympiad in Informatics.
- 👀 I’m interested in maths and computer science. As plain as it may seem this is basically what drives me into programming and liking it. I also love music and video games (both playing them and learning how they work), especially rhythm games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of object-oriented programming, administration of Linux-based operating systems and the usage of Git.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some simpler or smaller C/C++ projects simply because this programming language what I've been using for 6 years in competitive programming, although I'm confident in my ability to learn new things, so anything could be fitting. I'm more limited by the lack of programming experience rather than my abilites themselves.
